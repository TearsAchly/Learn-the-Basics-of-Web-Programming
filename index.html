    <h1>Bandung</h1>
    The largest metropolitan city in West Java Province, it also serves as the
    provincial capital.
    <h2>history</h2>

    <p>
      The word Bandung comes from the word "bendung" or "dam," referring to the
      damming of the Citarum River by the lava of Mount Tangkuban Parahu, which
      then formed a lake. A legend told by Bandung's elders says that the name
      Bandung comes from a watercraft consisting of two boats tied side by side,
      called a "bangdung boat," used by the Regent of Bandung, R.A.
      Wiranatakusumah II, to navigate the Citarum River in search of a new
      regency seat to replace the old capital in Dayeuhkolot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Based on Sundanese philosophy, the word Bandung also comes from the phrase
      Nga-Bandung-an Banda Indung, which is a sacred and sublime phrase because
      it embodies Sundanese teachings. "Nga-Bandung-an" means to witness or to
      bear witness. Banda refers to everything in the natural world, namely the
      earth and the atmosphere, both living and inanimate. A synonym for banda
      is treasure. Indung means Mother or Earth, also known as Mother Earth,
      where Banda is located.

    <h2>geographical</h2>

    <p>
      The city of Bandung is surrounded by mountains, so its morphology
      resembles a giant bowl. Geographically, the city is located in the center
      of West Java province, at an altitude of approximately 768 meters above
      sea level. The highest point is in the north at 1,050 meters above sea
      level, and the lowlands are in the south at 675 meters above sea level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bandung is crossed by two main rivers: the Cikapundung and the Citarum,
      along with their tributaries, which generally flow south and converge into
      the Citarum River. This makes South Bandung highly susceptible to
      flooding, especially during the rainy season.

    <h2>tour</h2>
    <p>
      Since the opening of the Cipularang Toll Road, Bandung has become a prime
      weekend getaway destination, especially for people from the surrounding
      Jakarta area. Besides being a shopping destination, Bandung is also known
      for its numerous old buildings with Dutch architectural heritage.

    <h3>Farm House Lembang</h3>
    <p>
      Located on the main Bandung-Lembang route, Farm House is a tourist
      attraction that's always crowded with visitors. Besides its strategic
      location, this area also offers a distinctly European tourist atmosphere.
