            The word Bandung comes from the word "bendung" or "dam," referring
            to the damming of the Citarum River by the lava of Mount Tangkuban
            Parahu, which then formed a lake. A legend told by Bandung's elders
            says that the name Bandung comes from a watercraft consisting of two
            boats tied side by side, called a "bangdung boat," used by the
            Regent of Bandung, R.A. Wiranatakusumah II, to navigate the Citarum
            River in search of a new regency seat to replace the old capital in
            Dayeuhkolot.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on Sundanese philosophy, the word Bandung also comes from the
            phrase Nga-Bandung-an Banda Indung, which is a sacred and sublime
            phrase because it embodies Sundanese teachings. "Nga-Bandung-an"
            means to witness or to bear witness. Banda refers to everything in
            the natural world, namely the earth and the atmosphere, both living
            and inanimate. A synonym for banda is treasure. Indung means Mother
            or Earth, also known as Mother Earth, where Banda is located.

          <p>
            The city of Bandung is surrounded by mountains, so its morphology
            resembles a giant bowl. Geographically, the city is located in the
            center of West Java province, at an altitude of approximately 768
            meters above sea level. The highest point is in the north at 1,050
            meters above sea level, and the lowlands are in the south at 675
            meters above sea level.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bandung is crossed by two main rivers: the Cikapundung and the
            Citarum, along with their tributaries, which generally flow south
            and converge into the Citarum River. This makes South Bandung highly
            susceptible to flooding, especially during the rainy season.

            Since the opening of the Cipularang Toll Road, Bandung has become a
            prime weekend getaway destination, especially for people from the
            surrounding Jakarta area. Besides being a shopping destination,
            Bandung is also known for its numerous old buildings with Dutch
            architectural heritage.
